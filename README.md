# Java Basics 🚀
A collection of beginner-friendly Java programs to strengthen my core understanding of the language. This repository includes Java syntax, flow control, arrays, strings, and basic problems commonly asked in interviews or programming challenges.

✅ Topics Covered

- ✅ Hello World
- ✅ Input/output using Scanner
- ✅ Variables, Data Types, Type Casting
- ✅ Control Statements (if, else, switch)
- ✅ Loops (for, while)
- ✅ Methods (static, return types, parameters)
- ✅ Arrays (1D, 2D, loop through arrays)
- ✅ String operations ('concatenation', length, charAt, equals, etc.)

🔹 Problem Examples
- ✔️ Print even/odd numbers in a range
- ✔️ Find max/min in an array
- ✔️ Count vowels in a string
- ✔️ Reverse a string or number
- ✔️ Check if a string is a palindrome
- ✔️ Basic pattern printing (pyramids, diamonds, stars)

📌 Goal
To demonstrate my understanding of core Java programming concepts through small, structured programs — useful for interview prep, academics, and personal mastery.
